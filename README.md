# mlProject
This project implements a Support Vector Machine and convolutional neural network models of varying complexity to identify the most accurate modelto classify images of bees. 
The challenge is made difficult due to the fact that each image has a colorful background which is the flower the bee is pollinating.
Bombus and apis pollinate a variety of flowers and tend to be attracted to the same vibrant colors. The comparison shows that transfer learning and using a deep residual neural network architecture is by far the most effective way to classify this data.
Achieved an overall accuracy of 89 percent with RESNET 50 Transfer Learning.
