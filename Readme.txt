Its a group project and we have created a different folder for each model.
Its an image classification project involving the bee image classification into different kind of bee.


# Instructions how to Reproduce the results:

EDA - Run Jupyter Notebook, data is in the EDA folder

SVM - the original bee image data is attached and will automatically load.

psuedo_resnet_20 - the original bee image data is attached and will automatically load. The augmented and black and white data sets must be created using the code. There are True False variables in the data loading section that can be modified to use the augmented and bw images. There are also models that can be loaded and plotted in tensorboard.

VanillaCNN - the original bee image data is attached and will automatically load. The augmented and black and white data sets must be created using the code. There are True False variables in the data loading section that can be modified to use the augmented and bw images.

Resnet50- the original bee image data is attached and will automatically load. The augmented and black and white data sets must be created using the code. There are True False variables in the data loading section that can be modified to use the augmented and bw images. Make sure the network is fed with rgb images without scaling.

Resnet20 - The weights can be loaded from the folder to reproduct the results.
